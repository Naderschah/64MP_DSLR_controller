This directory contains all code regarding image processing. 


The main files to worry about are:
- FocusFusion.jl
- CombineImages.jl


The first uses the MKR algorithm to Fuse the images 

The second uses the MIST algorithm to combine these into a large image. 

All of the files still need to be populated

TODO:
- Figure out how i stitched images
